$ git add . ( adding all files in the stage of the current repository to be commited) 
$ git add fileName ( Adding a single file) 
$ git commit -m "Message something" 

Until committing GIT won't save the changes in the repository.

$ git rm oldFileName (remove the file saved in the repository)

OR 

$ git mv oldFileName newFileName

7) Delete - 

$ git rm fileName
